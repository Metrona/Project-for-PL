Couldn't figure out how to properly use slcik2D before the deadline so searched around and found this tutorial to make the game
of course just following the tutorial wasn't really going to be much of a project so i adjusted some stuff about the game
(such as giving the alien's increased speed when more die or make it so they can only shoot 6 bombs at a time)
as to show that I actually understand how this thing works i even made a barricade class that stops the alien's shot but not your own
